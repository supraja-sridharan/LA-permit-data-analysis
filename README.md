# LA-permit-data-analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes **building permit activity in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024**, covering the COVID-19 pandemic, recovery phase, and subsequent construction boom.

Using permit-level data stored in **Snowflake**, the analysis examines how construction activity evolved over time, where it concentrated geographically, and how investment was distributed across project sizes. It provides a data-driven view of how everyday home improvements and capital-intensive projects collectively shape Los Angeles’s built environment.

### Key Findings
* **Shift to Renovation:** Construction growth was driven largely by **alterations, repairs, and infrastructure upgrades** rather than new builds.
* **Geographic Concentration:** Permit activity is highly clustered in specific ZIP codes, though high volume does not always equal high value.
* **Investment Inequality:** A small share of large-scale projects accounts for a disproportionate amount of total valuation, while many neighborhoods see high volume from low-cost repairs.
* **Fragmented Market:** The contractor landscape is highly fragmented, with thousands of small firms driving volume while a select few handle high-value developments.

### Tech Stack & Workflow
* **Snowflake:** Used as the primary Data Warehouse for storage and large-scale aggregations.
* **Python (Pandas):** Handled data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Used for visualizing trends in permit volume and valuation.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The interactive environment for the end-to-end analysis.
